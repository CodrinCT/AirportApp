# MyFirstWebApp
This is a web app that simulates the buying of a ticket from an airport. The application is made with spring.

It has a home page from which the user can register or authenticate and email the company for any complaint. From the application, the general user can buy a ticket for a flight, and it will be registered as passenger for said flight. The user with the authority of admin can view all the passengers for a certain flight and can cancel a passengerâ€™s ticket. The user with the authority manager is the one that can create or delete flights.

The authentication and controller security is done with the help of spring security. For views, I used thymeleaf. A little of HTML and CSS has been used for the home page.
